TODO list for MusicZapper
=========================

Bug fixes
---------


New features
------------

* Add Waveform Display widget that shows the waveform of the current media
 - Add cursor + interaction
 - locate it above the progress bar?
 - it's a 2-dimensional display:
   o x-axis = time (mm:ss)
   o y-axis = [-1..1] (%)



Non-functional stuff
--------------------

* Improve robustness (i.e. assertions correction:
lot of crashes is due to a misuse of QPlayList & QPlayer internals)

* Make a usable release, for user testing

* Refactor almost all, in order to:
 - simplify the classes
 - simplify the unit tests
